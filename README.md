## Project Overview

The system models a B2B marketplace with **three roles**:
- **Shop** (buyer) — browse products, send RFQs, review quotes, manage contracts, place orders
- **Supplier** (seller) — manage inventory, upload product images, respond to RFQs with quotes, confirm contracts/orders, process payments
- **Admin** (system controller) — approve/reject new users and products, monitor all RFQs, contracts, and system activity

The full B2B procurement flow is: **RFQ → Quote → Contract → Order → Payment**, following real-world B2B purchasing processes. The application is split into two independently deployable microservices, each running in its own Docker container on AWS ECS Fargate. The Admin role is hosted within the Supplier Service under a dedicated route prefix (`/admin/manage/*`) — a deliberate design choice to optimize costs while maintaining clean code separation (own controller, model, and views) that allows extraction into a 3rd service when scaling demands it.

Key design decisions:
- Three-role system (Shop, Supplier, Admin) with approval workflows
- End-to-end RFQ → Quote → Contract → Order → Payment flow
- Saga pattern for distributed transaction management with compensating actions
- Admin approval gates for new users and product listings
- S3-based image storage for product photos
- Security hardening with Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, and input validation
- Graceful shutdown for zero-downtime deployments
- Infrastructure-as-code approach for reproducible deployments
- Blue/green deployment strategy via CodeDeploy

```

Traffic routing is handled by a single Application Load Balancer with path-based rules:
- All requests to `/admin/*` are forwarded to the Supplier service
- All other requests are forwarded to the Shop service
- Health checks on `/health` ensure only healthy containers receive traffic

## Microservices

### Shop Service (Buyer)

Handles the buyer-facing experience. Shops browse products, send RFQs to suppliers, review quotes, accept/reject quotes to form contracts, and create orders from contracts.

| Responsibility | Description |
|---|---|
| Product browsing | View all approved products with images, search and filtering |
| RFQ management | Send Request for Quotation to suppliers for specific products |
| Quote review | Review supplier quotes, accept or reject them |
| Contract management | View contracts formed from accepted quotes |
| Order placement | Create orders from contracts with stock validation |
| Order tracking | View order history and current status |

### Supplier Service (Seller + Admin)

Handles seller operations and system administration. Suppliers manage inventory, respond to RFQs with quotes, confirm contracts and orders, and process payments. The Admin role (integrated here) approves users/products and monitors system activity. The Supplier Service has its own independent authentication flow (`/admin/login`, `/admin/register`, `/admin/logout`) with its own login and registration views — it does not redirect to the Shop Service for authentication.

| Responsibility | Description |
|---|---|
| Product management | Full CRUD with image upload to Amazon S3 |
| RFQ response | View incoming RFQs and submit quotes (price, MOQ, delivery) |
| Contract management | Confirm or cancel contracts formed from accepted quotes |
| Order management | View, confirm, or cancel incoming orders |
| Payment processing | Process payments for confirmed orders |
| **Admin: User approval** | Approve/reject new user registrations, delete users |
| **Admin: Product approval** | Approve/reject product listings before they go live |
| **Admin: System monitoring** | Dashboard with stats, view all RFQs and contracts |

Both services are stateless and connect to a shared MySQL database. Each service runs independently in its own container and can be scaled, updated, or restarted without affecting the other.

## Saga Workflow and Failure Handling

The system implements the Saga pattern for managing distributed transactions across the order lifecycle. Each step has a corresponding compensating action that executes on failure.

### End-to-End B2B Procurement Flow

```
Step 1: SEND RFQ (Shop Service)
  |  Shop selects a product and sends RFQ with desired quantity
  |  RFQ status: pending
  v
Step 2: SUBMIT QUOTE (Supplier Service)
  |  Supplier reviews RFQ and submits quote (unit_price, MOQ, delivery_days)
  |  RFQ status: quoted
  |
  |  [No response] --> RFQ remains pending
  v
Step 3: ACCEPT/REJECT QUOTE (Shop Service)
  |  Shop reviews quote and accepts or rejects
  |  [Accept] --> BEGIN TRANSACTION
  |                Update quote status: accepted
  |                Update RFQ status: accepted
  |                Create contract record
  |              COMMIT
  |  [Reject] --> Update quote status: rejected
  v
Step 4: CONFIRM CONTRACT (Supplier Service)
  |  Supplier confirms the contract
  |  Contract status: draft --> confirmed
  |
  |  [Cancel] --> Contract status: cancelled
  v
Step 5: CREATE ORDER FROM CONTRACT (Shop Service)
  |  Shop creates order linked to the contract
  |  BEGIN TRANSACTION
  |    Validate stock availability
  |    Insert order record (status: pending)
  |    Deduct stock from product
  |  COMMIT
  |
  |  [Failure] --> Rollback: no order created, stock unchanged
  v
Step 6: CONFIRM ORDER (Supplier Service)
  |  Supplier reviews and confirms the order
  |  Update order status: pending --> confirmed
  |
  |  [Reject] --> CANCEL ORDER (compensating transaction)
  |               Restore stock to product
  v
Step 7: PROCESS PAYMENT (Supplier Service)
  |  Validate payment method (bank_transfer, qr_code, cod)
  |  BEGIN TRANSACTION
  |    Insert payment record (status: success)
  |    Update order status: confirmed --> paid
  |  COMMIT
  |
  |  [Payment Failure] --> Compensating: cancel order + restore stock
  v
Step 8: ORDER COMPLETE
  Final state: order.status = 'paid', payment recorded
```

### Failure Scenarios Handled

| Scenario | Trigger | Compensating Action |
|---|---|---|
| Insufficient stock | Order quantity > available stock | Order rejected, no changes made |
| Product not found | Product deleted or inactive | Order rejected with error message |
| Order cancelled (pending) | Supplier cancels pending order | Stock restored to original level |
| Order cancelled (confirmed) | Supplier cancels confirmed order | Stock restored to original level |
| Payment failure | Database error during payment | Order cancelled + stock restored |
| Invalid payment method | Method not in whitelist | Request rejected with validation error |

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses AWS developer tools to implement a continuous deployment pipeline. **CodeBuild is not available in AWS Academy Learner Lab**, so Docker images are built and pushed to ECR manually from Cloud9. CodeDeploy blue/green deployments are then triggered manually via AWS CLI.

### Pipeline Stages

```
Stage 1: MANUAL BUILD (Cloud9 / Local)
  Developer builds Docker image and pushes to Amazon ECR
  Trigger: Manual docker push to ECR repository
      |
      v
Stage 2: DEPLOY (CLI → CodeDeploy → ECS Blue/Green)
  Trigger: Manual CLI command (aws deploy create-deployment)
  Strategy: Blue/Green deployment
  Process:
    1. Register new ECS task definition with updated image URI
    2. Create new task set (green) in standby target group
    3. Health check passes → ALB traffic switches to new tasks
    4. Old task set (blue) terminated after 5 minutes
  Config: appspec-*.yaml + taskdef-*.json in deployment/
```

> **Why no CodeBuild or CodePipeline?** AWS Academy Learner Lab does not include CodeBuild or CodePipeline in its allowed services. Images are built on Cloud9 and pushed directly to ECR. CodeDeploy blue/green deployments are triggered manually via AWS CLI.

### Pipeline Configuration Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `deployment/appspec-shop.yaml` | CodeDeploy ECS deployment spec for Shop |
| `deployment/appspec-supplier.yaml` | CodeDeploy ECS deployment spec for Supplier |
| `deployment/taskdef-shop.json` | ECS task definition for Shop (placeholders: `<IMAGE1_NAME>`, `<RDS-ENDPOINT>`, `<ACCOUNT-ID>` resolved during Phases 5.3 → 6.4 → 8.1) |
| `deployment/taskdef-supplier.json` | ECS task definition for Supplier (same placeholders + `S3_BUCKET` env var preset) |
| `deployment/create-shop-microservice-tg-two.json` | ECS service config with CODE_DEPLOY controller |
| `deployment/create-supplier-microservice-tg-two.json` | ECS service config with CODE_DEPLOY controller |

### Build and Deploy Workflow

```bash
# 1. Build Docker image locally or on Cloud9
cd microservices/shop
docker build -t shop .

# 2. Tag and push to ECR
account_id=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text)
docker tag shop:latest $account_id.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/shop:latest
docker push $account_id.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/shop:latest

# 3. Register a fresh ECS task definition revision (ECS only re-pulls on revision change)
SHOP_TASKDEF_ARN=$(aws ecs register-task-definition \
  --cli-input-json file://deployment/taskdef-shop.json \
  --query 'taskDefinition.taskDefinitionArn' --output text)

# 4. Render appspec with the new task def ARN (use temp copy to keep placeholder)
cp deployment/appspec-shop.yaml /tmp/appspec-shop-deploy.yaml
sed -i "s|<TASK_DEFINITION>|$SHOP_TASKDEF_ARN|g" /tmp/appspec-shop-deploy.yaml

# 5. Upload appspec to S3 + trigger CodeDeploy blue/green deployment
aws s3 cp /tmp/appspec-shop-deploy.yaml s3://b2b-marketplace-images/deploy/appspec-shop.yaml
aws deploy create-deployment \
  --application-name b2b-marketplace \
  --deployment-group-name b2b-shop-dg \
  --s3-location bucket=b2b-marketplace-images,key=deploy/appspec-shop.yaml,bundleType=YAML
```

> **Note:** The above 5 steps can be scripted into a `deploy.sh` helper if desired. Repeat the same process for the supplier service by replacing `shop` with `supplier` in the commands above.

## AWS Infrastructure

### Services Used

| AWS Service | Purpose | Configuration |
|---|---|---|
| Amazon ECS (Fargate) | Container orchestration | 2 services, 1 task each, 0.25 vCPU / 512MB RAM, `healthCheckGracePeriodSeconds: 90` to avoid premature kill during cold start |
| Amazon ECR | Docker image registry | 2 private repositories (shop, supplier) |
| Application Load Balancer | Traffic routing & health checks | Path-based routing (`/admin/*` → Supplier, default → Shop), 4 target groups for blue/green |
| Amazon RDS (MySQL 8.0) | Managed database | db.c6gd.medium, Single-AZ, 20GB gp3 |
| Amazon S3 | Product image storage | Public-read bucket for supplier product photos |
| AWS Cloud9 | Development environment | t3.small, Amazon Linux 2, for Docker builds and ECR pushes |
| AWS CodeCommit | Source code repository | Stores project code, main branch |
| AWS CodeDeploy | ECS blue/green deployments | 2 deployment groups, 4 target groups, auto-rollback on failure |
| ~~AWS CodePipeline~~ | ~~Pipeline orchestration~~ | Not available in Learner Lab — CodeDeploy triggered via CLI |
| Amazon CloudWatch | Logging and monitoring | Log groups: `/ecs/shop`, `/ecs/supplier`, CPU/memory alarms |

### Network Configuration

- VPC with public subnets (no NAT Gateway to reduce cost)
- Public subnets must have a default route (`0.0.0.0/0`) to an Internet Gateway so ECS tasks can pull images from ECR
- ECS tasks use `assignPublicIp: ENABLED` for ECR image pulls
- Security groups restrict RDS access to ECS tasks only (3-tier: ALB → ECS → RDS)
- ALB is internet-facing on port 80

---

## IAM Roles and Permissions

The project uses the pre-configured `LabRole` provided by AWS Academy Learner Lab. This role is assigned to multiple service contexts.

### Role Assignments

| Context | Role | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| ECS Task Execution Role | `LabRole` | Pull images from ECR, push logs to CloudWatch |
| ECS Task Role | `LabRole` | Runtime permissions: access RDS, S3, CloudWatch |
| ~~CodeBuild Service Role~~ | ~~`LabRole`~~ | ~~Not available in Learner Lab~~ |
| CodeDeploy Service Role | `LabRole` | Manage ECS deployments, ALB target groups |
| ~~CodePipeline Service Role~~ | ~~`LabRole`~~ | ~~Not available in Learner Lab~~ |
| RDS Management | `LabRole` | Database instance management |

### Permission Boundaries

The `LabRole` provides broad permissions across supported AWS services but operates within Learner Lab restrictions:
- Region limited to `us-east-1` and `us-west-2`
- Instance types limited to nano, micro, small, medium, and large
- Cannot create IAM users, groups, or custom roles
- Cannot enable RDS enhanced monitoring
- Maximum 9 concurrent EC2 instances

---

## Security Features

The application implements multiple layers of security:

| Layer | Implementation | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication | `bcryptjs` + `express-session` | Password hashing (10 salt rounds), session-based login, role-based access control |
| Auth Middleware | `requireAuth`, `requireAdmin` | All routes protected; unauthenticated users redirected to service-specific login (`/login` for Shop, `/admin/login` for Supplier); admin routes require admin role |
| HTTP Headers | `helmet` | Sets security headers: X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options |
| CORS | `cors` | Configurable origin restriction via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var |
| Rate Limiting | `express-rate-limit` | Global: 200 req/15min per IP. Write operations: 10-20 req/min per IP |
| Input Validation | Custom middleware | All params parsed and validated (type, range, length). NaN/injection checks |
| XSS Prevention | HTML tag stripping | All text inputs sanitized with regex `/<[^>]*>/g` removal |
| Payload Limits | Express body-parser | Request body capped at 1MB (10MB for image uploads) |
| File Validation | `multer` | Image uploads: 5MB max, JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP only |
| Trust Proxy | Express config | Correct client IP behind ALB for rate limiting |
| Error Handling | Global middleware | Production: generic messages. Development: stack traces |

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- No AWS account required for local testing (S3 uploads will fail locally but URL images from seed data will work)

### Running Locally

```bash
# Start all services (MySQL + Shop + Supplier)
docker-compose up --build

# Shop service:    http://localhost:8080
# Supplier panel:  http://localhost:8081/admin/
```

The database is automatically initialized with schema and seed data from `deployment/db-init.sql`, including placeholder product images from Unsplash.

### Demo Credentials

| Email | Password | Role | Service |
|---|---|---|---|
| `shop1@b2bmarket.com` | `password123` | Shop | Shop (`/login`) |
| `supplier1@b2bmarket.com` | `password123` | Supplier | Supplier (`/admin/login`) |
| `admin@b2bmarket.com` | `password123` | Admin | Supplier (`/admin/login`) |

### Stopping

```bash
docker-compose down          # Stop services, keep data
docker-compose down -v       # Stop services, delete database volume
```
